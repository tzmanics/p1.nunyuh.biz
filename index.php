  <p>
    I'm a strong, inquisitive, scottish-filipino-serbian lady heading towards 
    the end of my 20's. I work as a part-time staff assistant to a bunch of 
    grad. students, scientists, engineers, physicists, and 1 professor at an 
    atmospheric research group. I also work full-time at bettering myself as 
    a crafter, cook, designer, developer and CS student at the Extension 
    School. I love long walks...up mountains, coding, creating, gourmand-ing 
    and my dog, Toshi.
