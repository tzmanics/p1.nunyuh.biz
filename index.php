		<p>I'm a strong, inquisitive, scottish-filipino-serbian lady heading towards the end of my 20's.
		I work as a part-time staff assistant to a bunch of grad. students, scientists, engineers, physicists, and 1 professor at an atmospheric research group.
		I also work full-time at bettering myself as a crafter, cook, designer, developer and CS student at the Extension School.
		I love long walks...up mountains, coding, creating, gourmand-ing and my dog, Toshi.</p>
